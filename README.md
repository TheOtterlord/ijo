</p>

All websites need to be hosted. cPanel is currently the most popular web host manager there is, but it only works if you're running centos or redhat, which are both linux-based. This makes hosting servers less accessible to the everyday user. To fix this, **IJO is available on all major platforms.**<br>
The alternatives to cPanel often come with a lot of modules you really don't need. For example, when you're just installing an Apache Web Server to host your server it'll also install a SMTP server, FTP server, DNS server and other modules. **IJO gives you a clutter-free and modular option to host your websites.**<br>
Another issue with many webhosting solutions is that they're very user-unfriendly because of their complicated UI's. **With IJO we're focussing on creating a user-friendly UI for both hosting companies and their customers and self-hosting hobbyists.**

## Usage
IJO is currently still in its development phase and can only be run using [@ijo-sm/ijo-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ijo-sm/ijo-test). Star and/or watch the repository to be kept up-to-date about new features and the eventual release.

## Contribute
You can test all repositories, like ijo and ijo-machine, using the [@ijo-sm/ijo-test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ijo-sm/ijo-test) package from NPM. Before testing make sure that your console's working directory is the repository you want to test. Install and run ijo-test with the following commands:
```bash
# Installs the latest version of @ijo-sm/ijo-test
$ npm i -g @ijo-sm/ijo-test
# Runs the test command
$ ijo-test
```
